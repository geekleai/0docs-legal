## 1. Introduction and Acceptance
These Terms of Use (the **“Terms”**) govern your access to and use of the 0DOCS Platform Pilot Program (the **“Platform”** or **“Service”**), which is provided by 0DOCS CORP. (**“0DOCS,” “we,” “us,” or “our”**). By self-onboarding to the Platform (e.g., by clicking “**Accept and Continue**” or a similar mechanism), you indicate that you have read, understand, and agree to these Terms, including the Privacy Policy section below. If you do not agree, you must not use the Platform.

These Terms form a binding legal agreement between you (and the organization you represent, if applicable) and 0DOCS. You represent that you are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) and have the legal authority to accept these Terms. If you are accepting on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms.

Pilot Nature: You understand that the Platform is provided as a pilot program (a limited release). As such, features and functionality may be experimental or in development. 0DOCS reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Platform (in whole or part) at any time during the pilot.

## 2. Platform Description

**0DOCS Platform:** The Platform is a document and data processing service that utilizes advanced AI models to assist with content generation, analysis, or other functionalities. Specifically, 0DOCS hosts and operates the Platform using cloud services from Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and Microsoft Azure (“Azure”). Through these services, the Platform integrates OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise and Anthropic’s Claude Enterprise models to generate responses and outputs based on user inputs.

**Cloud Environment:** All processing of your inputs (prompts, documents, data) and the AI’s responses (“outputs”) happens within 0DOCS’s controlled cloud environment on AWS Bedrock and Azure OpenAI. This means your data is handled by 0DOCS’s third-party cloud providers solely to run the AI models on our behalf. Both AWS and Azure maintain strict data protection standards:

- **AWS’s Amazon Bedrock service** does not store or use your prompts and completions for any purpose beyond fulfilling your request.  
   [docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%20doesn%27t%20store%20or,distribute%20them%20to%20third%20parties)  
   In other words, your input is not retained in AWS logs, nor used to train any AWS or Anthropic models.  
   [docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%20doesn%27t%20store%20or,distribute%20them%20to%20third%20parties)

- **Azure’s OpenAI Service** processes your prompts in a similar way. Your prompts and the AI outputs are not used to train or improve OpenAI’s models, not shared with other customers, and not sent to OpenAI’s own servers.  
   [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy#:~:text=,available%20exclusively%20for%20your%20use)  
   Microsoft may temporarily retain the content of requests for abuse monitoring (up to ~30 days) but then deletes it, and such data is encrypted in transit and at rest.  
   [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/2181252/azure-openai-data-retention-privacy-2025#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20latest%20updates%2C,is%20not%20accessible%20to%20other)  
   During retention it is inaccessible to OpenAI or other third parties.  
   [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/2181252/azure-openai-data-retention-privacy-2025#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20latest%20updates%2C,is%20not%20accessible%20to%20other)

**No Public Training Use:** Neither 0DOCS nor our AI partners will use your data to improve or train their general AI models. *Any data you input is only used to generate the output for you during your session. For example, OpenAI explicitly commits that it does not use business data or API inputs to train its models by default ([openai.com](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy/#:~:text=,your%20business%20data%20by%20default)), and our integration with Azure OpenAI adheres to that policy. Your data remains confidential and isolated within the Platform’s environment.*

**Service Features:** As part of the pilot, the Platform may allow you to upload documents or enter text queries, which the AI models will process to produce results (such as summaries, answers, or other content). 0DOCS may add, remove, or modify features during the pilot based on testing and user feedback.


## 3. User Accounts and Access
In order to access the Platform, you may need to create an account or be provided one by 0DOCS. Account Security: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to use strong passwords and keep them secure. If you believe your account has been compromised or accessed without authorization, you must notify 0DOCS immediately.

0DOCS may impose eligibility requirements or access controls (for example, limiting the pilot to certain users or geographies). You agree to provide accurate and current information for your account registration (if applicable), and to keep it updated.


## 4. Acceptable Use Policy
You agree to use the Platform only for its intended purposes and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for all content you input into the Platform and any content that the Platform outputs that you choose to use or share. By using the Service, you agree NOT to engage in any of the following prohibited activities:

- **Unlawful or Harmful Content:** Do not use the Platform to input, upload, generate, transmit, or store any content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, defamatory, obscene, offensive, harassing, or that violates any law or right of any person. This includes content that is invasive of privacy, or that you do not have the rights or consent to use (e.g. personal data of others, copyrighted material) without permission.


- **Misuse of AI Outputs:** Do not use the AI-generated outputs to deliberately spread misinformation, create malicious software, generate spam/phishing content, or for any unethical or harmful purposes. You must comply with any usage guidelines provided by 0DOCS or its AI providers. (For example, OpenAI and Anthropic have policies against using their AI for illicit behavior, hate, harassment, etc. You agree to uphold those standards in your use of the Platform.)


- **Security Violations:** Do not attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Platform or any related system or network. Do not attempt to bypass or circumvent any security or authentication measures. Refrain from any attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise extract the source code or underlying models of the Platform or the AI services.


- **Service Integrity:** Do not interfere with or disrupt the proper functioning of the Platform. This includes not deploying any viruses, malware, or any other code intended to harm or interfere with the Service or other users. Also, do not use automated systems (such as bots or scripts) to send requests to the Platform in a manner that overloads or abuses the service.


- **Unauthorized Access:** Do not access or use the Platform by any means other than the interface and instructions provided by 0DOCS. You may not access the Service to build a competing product or service, or copy any features, functions, or graphics of the Service. Any attempt to use the AI services outside the scope of this Platform (such as directly via AWS/Azure in an unauthorized way) is prohibited.


- **No Violation of Others’ Rights:** Do not use the Platform in a manner that infringes or misappropriates any third-party intellectual property rights or other rights. You are responsible for ensuring you have the necessary rights to any data or content you input. If you upload documents, make sure you have permission to use that content with our Service.


0DOCS reserves the right to monitor usage for compliance with this Acceptable Use Policy and to suspend or terminate any user’s access for violations (see Section 8 on Termination). We may also filter or restrict certain requests that we deem in violation (for example, the AI may refuse to generate disallowed content).

## **5. Ownership and Intellectual Property**

**Your Content:** 0DOCS does **not claim ownership** of the content or data that you (the user) provide to the Platform, or the AI-generated outputs returned to you. **You own your inputs and outputs.** As between you and 0DOCS, all intellectual property rights in the content you supply remain with you (or your licensors). The outputs generated by the AI are derived from your inputs and the AI’s knowledge; to the extent possible under applicable law and third-party terms, 0DOCS assigns and transfers to you any rights it may have in the outputs. _Keep in mind that AI outputs are generated uniquely for you, but they may be based on patterns learned from broad data. It is your responsibility to review outputs for any sensitive or third-party content._

You grant 0DOCS (and its service providers, such as AWS/Azure and the AI model providers) a **limited license** to your input content **solely for the purpose of operating the Platform and providing the service to you**. This means we can process, transmit, and display your content as needed to generate results, and store it temporarily or in cached form when necessary (but always under the restrictions in these Terms and the Privacy Policy).

**Platform and 0DOCS IP:** The Platform (including the software, user interface, underlying algorithms, and all content provided by 0DOCS such as tutorials, templates, etc.) is the intellectual property of 0DOCS or its licensors. 0DOCS retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Platform and Service, including all related intellectual property rights, trademarks, and logos. Your use of the Platform does not grant you any ownership in our IP. We grant you a revocable, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Platform during the pilot **for your internal business use or personal use** (as applicable), in accordance with these Terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on our Platform or content, except as allowed in these Terms or with our written permission.

**Feedback:** If you choose to provide any feedback, suggestions, or ideas regarding the Platform (“**Feedback**”) to 0DOCS, you agree that 0DOCS is free to use and incorporate that Feedback in any manner, without any obligation or compensation to you. You hereby grant 0DOCS a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, and incorporate any Feedback you provide. (This helps us improve the product – for example, if you suggest a new feature or point out an issue, we can use your suggestion without restriction.)


## **6. Disclaimer of Warranties**

**AS-IS Service:** The 0DOCS Platform is provided on an “**as is**” and “**as available**” basis **for pilot and evaluation purposes**. To the maximum extent permitted by law, 0DOCS disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, regarding the Platform and any results or outputs generated. This includes, but is not limited to, any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, accuracy, and reliability.

**AI Output Uncertainty:** 0DOCS **does not guarantee** that the AI-generated content will be correct, complete, or meet your expectations. The AI models attempt to generate helpful responses, but they may occasionally produce incorrect or inappropriate content. You use the outputs **at your own risk**. We strongly recommend that you **do not rely on AI outputs without independent verification**, especially for critical decisions or information. Any guidance or information given by the AI is not professional advice by 0DOCS.

**No Guarantee of Availability:** 0DOCS does not warrant that the Platform will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. Because this is a pilot, there may be occasional outages, updates, or changes that affect availability. We are not responsible for any delay, downtime, or data loss that may occur. (However, we will do our best to maintain a stable service and protect your data as described.)

**No Warranty on Third-Party Services:** While 0DOCS integrates respected third-party services (AWS, Azure, OpenAI, Anthropic), we do not make any warranties on their behalf. We rely on their stated practices (for example, regarding data privacy and security), but 0DOCS is not liable for any issues attributable to those third-party components. That said, **we have taken steps to ensure** our vendors maintain high standards (e.g., AWS and Azure are reputable for security, and they do not use your data for their own purposes​

## **7. Limitation of Liability**

**Limited Liability:** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, **0DOCS and its officers, directors, employees, and affiliates will not be liable** for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, or any loss of profits, revenues, data, or use, or cost of substitute goods or services, arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Platform or AI outputs, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion of certain damages, some of these limitations may not apply to you. **Nothing in these Terms limits liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or any other liability that cannot be excluded by law.**

**Cap on Direct Damages:** To the extent permitted by law, the total cumulative liability of 0DOCS arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service **will not exceed $100 USD** or the amount you paid to 0DOCS for the use of the Service in the last 6 months (if any), **whichever is greater**. This limitation applies to all claims of liability (e.g. warranty, contract, tort, etc.) and even if a limited remedy fails of its essential purpose.

**User’s Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for any consequences of your use of the Platform. This includes any decisions you make based on AI outputs, and any claims or disputes arising from the content you provide or results you obtain. For example, if you input someone else’s data without permission and that causes a legal issue, or if you rely on an incorrect AI answer and incur a loss, **that responsibility is yours**, not 0DOCS’s. By using the Service, you agree that you understand these risks and limitations.


## **8. Indemnification**

You agree to **indemnify, defend, and hold harmless 0DOCS CORP. and its affiliates, and their directors, officers, employees, and agents** (the “**Indemnified Parties**”) from and against any and all third-party claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) that arise out of or relate to: (a) your use of the Platform, (b) any content you provide to the Platform, **including any allegation that such content infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property or privacy rights of a third party**, (c) your violation of any law or regulation in using the Service, or (d) your breach of these Terms.

0DOCS reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (in which case you agree to cooperate with 0DOCS in asserting any available defenses). This indemnity obligation will survive any termination or expiration of these Terms and your use of the Platform.


## **9. Termination**

**By You:** You are free to stop using the Platform at any time. You may also request deletion of your account or data as described in the Privacy Policy. Participation in the pilot is voluntary.

**By 0DOCS:** 0DOCS may suspend or terminate your access to the Platform or terminate these Terms at any time **for any reason**. For example, we may do so if you violate the Acceptable Use Policy or any other provision of these Terms, if required by our service providers, if we suspect misuse that could harm others or the system, or if the pilot program is ending or transitioning to a different phase. In most cases, we will attempt to give you notice (e.g., via email or through the platform) if your access will be terminated, but we may not be able to do so in emergency cases of abuse.

**Effect of Termination:** Upon termination of your access or the pilot program, your right to use the Platform will immediately cease. Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (such as indemnification, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and governing law) will continue to apply. If the pilot ends or your access is removed, 0DOCS will handle your data in accordance with the Privacy Policy (generally by deleting or returning your content, unless we are required to retain it for legal reasons).


## **10. Paid Accounts**

**Billing:** If you purchase any Services from 0DOCS (such as a paid subscription or additional features beyond the free pilot), you agree to provide complete and accurate billing information, including a valid payment method. For recurring subscriptions, we will automatically charge your payment method on each agreed-upon periodic renewal date until you cancel. You are responsible for all applicable taxes, and we will charge tax where required by law. If your payment fails or cannot be completed, we may downgrade your account or suspend access to the paid features until payment is successfully received.

**Cancellation:** You may cancel your paid subscription at any time by sending a cancellation request to [support@geekle.ai](mailto:support@geekle.ai). Please include your account details so we can process your request. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, payments are non-refundable, including for any unused portion of the subscription. These Terms do not override any mandatory local laws regarding cancellation or refund rights.

**Changes:** We may update our pricing from time to time. If we increase our subscription prices, we will give you at least 30 days’ notice via email or in-platform communication. Any price increase will apply only to the next renewal term following the notice. If you do not agree with the new pricing, you may cancel your subscription before the next renewal to avoid the increased charge.


### **11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution**

These Terms (and any disputes arising out of or related to them or the use of the Platform) are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of Delaware, USA**, **excluding** its conflict-of-law principles. If you reside outside of the United States, you still agree that Delaware law will apply.

**Jurisdiction:** Except where prohibited by applicable law, you and 0DOCS agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in Delaware for the purpose of resolving any disputes. You agree to waive any objections to jurisdiction or venue in those courts. _(If you are a governmental or public entity that cannot legally agree to this section, please contact us to negotiate an appropriate provision.)_

**Injunctive Relief:** Notwithstanding the above, you agree that a breach or threatened breach of Sections 4 (Acceptable Use) or 5 (IP and ownership) may cause irreparable harm to 0DOCS for which monetary damages would be inadequate. 0DOCS may seek injunctive relief or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or stop any such breach, in addition to other rights and remedies.


### **12. Changes to Terms**

As this is a pilot program, we may update or modify these Terms of Use from time to time. If we make a material change, we will **notify you** by appropriate means – for example, by posting the updated Terms on the platform and updating the “Last Updated” date, and/or by sending a notice to the email associated with your account. We may also present the new Terms upon your next login to the Platform, in which case you may need to agree to continue using the Service.

**CONTINUER USE = ACCEPTANCE:** If you continue to use the Platform after the updated Terms become effective, you are indicating that you accept the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using the Platform. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically for any updates.
